<h3>Movie Review</h3> 
Simple Ruby on Rails app written in order to train following topics:
<ul>
<li>uploading posts (only for sign-in users)</li>
<li>adding abiliy to comment posts (also for sign-in users)</li>
<li>limitation for non sign-in users (as mentioned above)</li>
<li>adding 5-star rating using jquery plugin</li>
</ul>


It contains photos and short descriptions, so it helps to organize trip destinations. And for sign-in users - add comments and ratings. 

Some of gems I used: 
paperclip - for uploading images
devise - user authentication
simple-form - all of forms
